# Agent guides

The guides in this directory tell a coding agent how this release of Pixeltable behaves. They ship in the wheel,
so an agent reads the guides of its installed version.

This file is for whoever changes Pixeltable: it says what a guide contains, which guides exist, and when a change
has to update one.

## The split with the skill

An agent that builds an application reads two sources:

- The Pixeltable skill ([pixeltable/pixeltable-skill](https://github.com/pixeltable/pixeltable-skill)) teaches
  judgment that does not change between releases: how a conventional design maps to tables, computed columns and
  routes, how to design a schema, which stacks to avoid, and which changes need the user's approval.
- The guides state what this release does: what an API does, its defaults, edge cases, errors and limits, and its
  known issues, with their workarounds.

Neither repeats signatures, parameter lists or flag lists: the docstrings and `pxt COMMAND --help` give those for
the installed version.

## Which guides exist

One guide per functional area of the public API: the APIs that an agent uses together for one job. `tables.md`
covers declaring tables, writing rows, schema changes and versions; the other guides cover expressions, queries, views,
indexes, UDFs, Json, providers, serving, the CLI and Cloud.

Add a guide when a new area does not fit an existing one. Split a guide when it no longer reads as one job.

## What a guide contains

- Behavior that a signature does not show: what is stored or recomputed, what is atomic, what runs in which order,
  which defaults matter, and the errors, with their messages.
- Known issues, each with its ticket id, until the fix ships.
- Examples in application form (`TableModel` classes) first, and in notebook form where that form differs.

A guide leaves out design advice, which belongs in the skill, and version history, since each wheel ships its own
guides: write what this release does, not since when.

## When to update a guide

- A pull request that changes user-visible behavior updates the guide of each area it touches, in the same pull
  request.
- A fix for a known issue removes or rewrites its entry.
- A new public API area gets a guide.

## Format and tests

- Markdown in ASCII, one fact per bullet, in plain sentences.
- The first line after the title summarizes the guide; `pxt guide` lists it.
- A reference to another guide is its command, such as `pxt guide tables`, since an agent may read the guide from
  `pxt guide` or from a copy.
- `tests/test_agent_guides.py` runs the `python` blocks of each guide in order, as one module, against a new
  catalog, and then calls `create_all()` on each `TableModel` base in the module. Blocks can define UDFs,
  application classes and notebook tables. They must not insert rows into a column that calls a provider: the test
  has no keys. A guide that imports a package missing from the environment is skipped.
- The same test checks every `pxt` line of a `bash` block: the command exists, and so does each flag on the line.
